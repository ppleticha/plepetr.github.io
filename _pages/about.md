A PhD student at Institute of Economic Studies at Charles University and a policy advisor and team coordinator at the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament of the Czech Republic for the Pirate Party. 

Being a vocal proponent of informed decision-making, I am curious about ways of conveying statistical inference to other researchers, policy-makers, and also to general public. Standard applied econometrics, machine learning, big data analysis, and data visualizations are all areas of my interest.

Research
======
My research revolves around the transmission of knowledge and technology in the economy. I look into the global value chain integration and inspect the different ways it affects productivity (first dissertation paper). Using data on R&D expenditure in the Czech Republic, I estimate the direct R&D returns and also the spillovers to other industries (second dissertation paper). The third paper is planned to bridge the previous two and see how R&D efforts steer the impacts of value chain integration in the right direction.
